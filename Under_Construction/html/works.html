            <h3>µLook (micro-look) is a mock-up application that was presented in our Human-Computer Interactions subject. We had individual ideas but mine was chosen by the group so I lead this project. The idea is to make a smartphone application to assist special smartphone microscopic lenses that has various uses such as predetermining a vast number of known microscoping creatures online and offline via downloadable libraries and broadcasting live micrograph and videos to your acquaintances around the world. After we presented this, the panels told us that this were the best idea so far and we are the last presenter in ou section. One thing that I can't forget is  one of them said that (not in verbatim) the Institute needs more people that has ideas like ours. </h3>

            <h3>This idea came out of my mind on the day we are required to pass a theoretical invention and a short description. The concept was a Home Power Management System that I named Perun Sprava.Perun is a Slavic God of thunder and Sprava is the slovak word wor management hence the name Perun Sprava. It is a bit exaggerated for a thunder God to manage your electric consumptions but it sounds cool, doesn't it? The symbol shown is <i>Gromoviti znaci</i> or thunder marks that are considered by some scholars as "ancient symbols of Perun” The description below was our initial and original description made instantly on the deadline. It was revised and backed some related literatures and became one of the best ideas in our section. Because of that we are included in the University seminars for patenting but we didn't push through it.

This will ensure safety on your home’s power system and your electronics. All of this is possible by integrating our HPMS into your home’s power lines. Our HPMS will be installed with your circuit breaker and will have micro-breaker attached on each end of your power outlets, light switches, and other power passages connected to your home’s power network that will allow you to monitor each outlets’ power output and consumption. A fail-safe system and power surge protection is added to each regulators to ensure safety of the HPMS and your electronics that are plugged on the outlets. For maximum operation the HPMS also have a built in UPS that could last hours. <br>

&nbsp&nbspThis has a powerful app that is connected via the internet that will make use of the data gathered by your HPMS and gives you a visual representation of your power line status. In the app you will be able to access different features of the HPMS. One is you will have a statistics of your daily, monthly and even yearly power consumption and allows you to input  power consumption  limits in which the app will notify you when you reached your specified power consumption limit thus helping you regulate your power usage and save energy. The app also feature an alarm system when you leave your home with appliances that are dangerous when left plug-in for too long, for example Iron and ovens, and allows you to remotely via the internet turn off that specific outlet where that appliance was plugged saving you from possible explosions or fire. Thirdly the system will also notify you the most efficient power consumption routine, the best time to use your daily appliances, optimum hours of usage, and the best appliances to be used simultaneously. All of this is possible by analyzing your power consumption and making use of the data gathered by the HPMS. Notification is also available via SMS in case of power interruption and other power hitches. You can also control via SMS commands but only limited to turning the power on and off on specific mico-breaker.
